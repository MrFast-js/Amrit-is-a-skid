# Amrit's skidded bot 
This is Amrit's bot claims we "stole" and that we skidded EzKits off of his bot. He stole it from https://github.com/Cody4687/CCorp-Bot/ aswell as https://github.com/Cody4687/GenBot
Amrit can not code he skid's and he claims we stole his code this is wrong our code is orignally coded I made it WITH Cody4687 as a bot from scratch and it clearly shows with how different our bot is here : https://mrfast-js.github.io
